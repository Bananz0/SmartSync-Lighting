# SmartSync Lighting - Detailed Project Specification

## Project Overview

SmartSync Lighting is an innovative project designed to synchronize smart lighting systems with Spotify music, creating an immersive audiovisual experience across multiple smart home platforms.

## Current Features

### Spotify Track Detection
- Real-time retrieval of currently playing track information
- Fetches track, artist, and album artwork using Spotify API
- Seamless integration with Spotify's music streaming platform

### Dynamic Color Extraction
- Advanced color analysis of album artwork
- Extract multiple dominant colors from images
- Prioritize center-focused and global dominant colors
- Intelligent color selection algorithm

### Multi-Platform Smart Home Integration
- Initial support for SmartThings
- Planned expansions to include:
  - Philips Hue
  - LIFX
  - Govee

### Color Processing and Validation
- Comprehensive color validation for lighting compatibility
- ANSI terminal color previews for debugging
- Adaptive color matching across different lighting platforms

### Configuration Management
- Centralized configuration loader
- Secure management of API credentials
- Flexible endpoint configuration
- Support for environment variables and configuration files

## Key Components

### Core Modules

#### SpotifyHandler
- Spotify API communication
- Track and artwork retrieval
- Real-time music metadata extraction

#### ColorProcessor
- Dominant color extraction using advanced image processing
- Support for OpenCV and PIL libraries
- Color normalization and focus techniques

#### LightingOrchestrator
- Coordinate Spotify data with lighting synchronization
- Implement dynamic color fallback strategies
- Manage cross-platform lighting updates

### Utility Modules

## Code Snippets

### Color Extraction
```python
colors = ColorProcessor.extract_dominant_colors(
    album_art, 
    num_colors=5, 
    focus_center=True
)
```

### Color Validation
```python
@staticmethod
def is_color_displayable(color):
    min_intensity, max_intensity = 10, 245
    return all(min_intensity <= c <= max_intensity for c in color)
```

### Dynamic Color Selection
```python
displayable_color = None
for color_set in [normalized_center_colors, normalized_global_colors]:
    for color in color_set:
        if ColorProcessor.is_color_displayable(color):
            displayable_color = color
            break
    if displayable_color:
        break
```
